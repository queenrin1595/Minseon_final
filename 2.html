<P style="margin-top:30px"><h3>Solution 1</h3>
: Many businesses, public libraries, and schools, though closed to visitors, have kept their internet signals on or have expanded them with signal boosters to include their parking lots. This has become a lifeline for students of all ages that have little to no access to the internet at home.</strong> Many colleges have certain parking lot hours and social distancing guidelines, such as one empty parking space between cars. This has been especially helpful for students and teachers alike that live in rural areas where WiFi is spotty at best, no matter how updated your hardware is. Students can take their laptops or phones to <strong>these WiFi hotspots which allows them to connect and do their schoolwork, watch lectures, and take tests</strong>. Also, the public spaces allow students who do not have smartphones or computers to use the deployed electronic devices for their lecture.
<P style="margin-top:30px"><h3>Solution 2</h3>
: <strong>If accessing the internet is difficult, another option includes working with your teachers or your kidsâ€™ teachers to have downloadable slideshows, videos, assignments, and even exams.</strong> This will allow students to connect to the internet just for the duration of the downloads, then you can return home and work on schoolwork there, which may be a more comfortable location. Once the content has been downloaded, students can access it without needing a continuous connection to the internet, making it possible to complete assignments from anywhere.</P>
