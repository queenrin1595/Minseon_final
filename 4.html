<P style="margin-top:45px"><H1> In summary,</H1>
We believe that the solution to the problem of the poverty-driven educational gap is educational service. Choosing teachers through strict documentation procedures and teaching children from one family per teacher can help bridge the educational gap among low-income families.
Youth have always been at the forefront of societal change; they play a critical role in solving major challenges of inequalities as they stand to lose the most. Nonetheless, national leaders should also show their support for this initiative, as it will assist them in efficiently acquiring knowledge and skills for their cause. In combating educational inequality, Youth could show their support through:
Raising awareness/voices on social platforms for the affected or marginalized groups in their countries in the field of education.
Volunteers to provide basic ICT skills for rural lecturers to set up online educational content for distant learning.
Encourage youth to set up charities/donations for the distribution of capable electronic devices to the less fortunate students.</P>
