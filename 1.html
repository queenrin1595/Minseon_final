<h2>The COVID-19 pandemic took the world into an unprompted “new normal”;</h2>

<u>It restricted everyone from going out of their houses; interrupted businesses, and more distinctively, it has delayed the economy. As a perceptible result, it has not only revealed the already existing socio-economic gap but has also exacerbated it. Now, the  ASEAN region was not an exception to this. Simply looking into its education sector will unveil its persisting problem of socio-economic inequalities, augmented by the COVID-19 pandemic.</u>
Prior to the pandemic, the ASEAN countries were already disproportionate in terms of achieving the Sustainable Development Goal of ensuring an inclusive and equitable quality of education, with poverty as one of the primary causes (Association of Southeast Asian Nations, 2020b). However, under the circumstances of the pandemic, the educational gap in the region is expected to further expand as the education sector suffers even more for the following reasons:
As businesses were negatively impacted, with some of them closing down, millions in the labor sector have been laid off, resulting in a large number of school dropouts from affected families.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had the education sector relying mostly on the internet and technological devices to which the poorer households have less to no access. Moreover, traditional materials are also more difficult to acquire in remote learning. In addition to this, poorer households also tend to lack a conducive environment for learning.
Alongside businesses, schools have also been led to closures due to lack of funds, insufficient enrollees, and the inability to digitalize.</a>
